# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
= Timely delivery is crucial in SPM because it keeps the project on schedule and project managers can ensure deadlines are met through clear project documentation, detailed planning, effective communication, risk management, resource management and  quality management (monitoring + reporting).
--------------------

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
= The effectiveness of cost control is crucial for the success of a software project because of: budget adherence, resource utilisation, risk mitigation and stakeholder satisfaction.
= Cost control should be used to prevent budget overruns, also make use of technology integration like Trello(resource managment software), as well as resource leveling and cost variance to measure the difference between budgeted and actual costs.
----------------------

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
= Agile :
   - Iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development.
   - Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.

     Main advantage:
     - Quick response to changes.
    
     Main disadvantage:
     - Less predictability.

  Waterfall:
   - Linear and sequential approach.
   - Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

     Main advantage:
     - Clear structure and documentation.
    
     Main disadvantage:
     - Difficult to accommodate changes.
---------------

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
= Agile might be beneficial in projects that need flexiblity, have customer involvement and rapid delivery like marketing campaigns or customised software developments from start ups(Mall directory app for elderly people)
= Waterfall might be beneficial in projects that have well-defined requirements and sequential processes like developing a new application where the design and specifications are clearly defined.
----------------

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
= QA methods include: defining quality goals, developing a quality assurance plan, process-oriented approach, code reviews + inspections(QA activity), and user acceptance testing.
= It's important to maintain high standards because of compliance and security, it ensures that the project deliverables meet the required standards and satisfy customer expectations.
----------------

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
= By defining the project scope, you set a solid foundation for planning, executing, and controlling the project, ultimately leading to its success because it set clear objectives, enhances communication and set boundaries around time, cost and resources.
= A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a project management tool that breaks down a project into smaller, more manageable components. WBS can be used to clarify and focus, improve planning, risk management, and enables better control within project.

 - Budget management
 - Risk management
 - Resource allocation
 - Stakeholder satisfaction

= Gantt charts assists in visual charity, progress tracking and time management
----------------------

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
= The core issues are typically scope, time, and budget. It highlights specific pain points faced by your target audience.
----------------

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
=It explains how the software directly addresses the problem mentioned and highlights the key features and functionalities that make your solution effective.
----------------------

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
=  By emphasizing the benefits users will gain from using your software. Focus on improved efficiency, cost savings, enhanced user experience, etc.
----------------------------------

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
= Product features and its benefits.
-------------------

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
= It provides data on the current market size and projected growth. Making use of credible sources and up-to-date statistics.
--------------------

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
= Undestanding relevant trends that makes it an opportune time for the software. This could include technological advancements, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer behavior.
